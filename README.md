# Service assessment - technical

## 3. Have a multidisciplinary team
Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service owner with decision-making responsibility.

- show you understand where gaps may emerge in the team and how to fill them
- explain your plan to transfer knowledge and skills from contractors to permanent staff
- show that there’s a person on your team who’s responsible for user research and usability tests
- show you’ll have a team that can keep improving the service after it goes live
- show the team fully understands the service after it’s gone live

### Example questions
- what different technical specialities do you have within the team?
- how have you engaged with other teams such as QA, centralised devops, technical architecture, technical design authorities, pen testing?
- if one or two people left, how would this impact delivery and how quickly could it be mitigated?
- do you have any single points of failure? how are they mitigated?

## 4. Use agile methods

Build your service using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the manual.

### You need to
- explain how you’re working in an agile way, using agile tools and techniques
    - stories and spikes
    - PRs
    - automated tested / CI
    - deployment pipeline / CD
- explain how you and your team have reviewed and iterated the ways you work to fix problems
